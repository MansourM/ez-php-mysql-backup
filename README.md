## :star2: About the Project

I felt the need for this project when per client request I had to have an automated backup system on a windows 7 32-bit,
but when trying to get other libs to work, I found myself playing a game of whack-a-mole with different bugs and
compatibility issues.

these libs were either using newer software or system commands that were not compatible with windows 7.

I started looking for a pure PHP (no real CLI command/new software needed) that could cover all my needs, and while
myphp-backup did the job, I needed some core and quality-of-life features that it was missing. so I started this project
based on it.
